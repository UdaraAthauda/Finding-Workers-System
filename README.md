Web Application for Finding Workers

I developed a robust web application using the Python Django framework, designed to connect users with workers across various fields. This platform includes several essential features to enhance user experience and functionality:

User Login: A secure login system that allows users to create and manage their accounts.
Advertisement Posting: Users can post advertisements about available workers in multiple working areas, making it easy to find the right person for the job.
Advertisement Viewing: Users can browse through posted advertisements to find workers that meet their needs.
Contacting Workers: The application provides contact details, enabling users to directly reach out to workers for their services.
Profile Management: Logged-in users can manage their profiles, update their information, and keep track of their interactions.
Admin Contact: Users can easily contact the web application administrators for support or inquiries.

This application aims to streamline the process of finding and hiring workers, offering a user-friendly interface and robust features to meet the needs of both users and workers.
